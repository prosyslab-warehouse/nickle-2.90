Description: desk calculator language
 Nickle is a language with powerful programming and scripting capabilities.
 Nickle supports a variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision
 integers, rationals, and imprecise reals.  The input language vaguely
 resembles C.  Some things in C which do not translate easily are different,
 some design choices have been made differently, and a very few features are
 simply missing.
